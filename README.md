**Unit Converter** is a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly application that lets you quickly convert between different units of **weight**, **temperature**, and **distance**.

This project is based on the **Unit Converter** challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter),
with a focus on simplicity, usability, and providing a responsive **web interface** that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

The application is built with **Java 21** and **Spring Boot**, using **Thymeleaf templates** for the web UI.
All conversions are performed in-memory, keeping the app lightweight, fast, and easy to understand.
